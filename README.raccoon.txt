Evaluation of the life of a raccoon, George
1. import the build-in module -math, which will be used to calculate the distance later
2. open the text file containing the initial data('2008Male00006.txt') about George
3. prepare to write new data into the output file:'Georges_life.txt'
4. read the initial data as lines
5. store the data of lines in 'Data', and split items by comma
6. store the values of columns to be sublists in 'temp_a'
7. convert the type of items in the 'temp_a' to be in proper types: column 4 is int, columns 5-6 and 9-15 are float and column 5 is Boolean
8. store the data into dictionary-'dic' 
9. store the last line which contains only one field that provides George's status at the end of the model simulation in the initial file
10. print dic and check the result

11. define the function-'mean' that can calculate the average of a bunch of values
12. use the 'mean' function to calculate the average x laction, y location and energy level of George
13. calculate the distance that George moved per hour and sum the values of distance
14. write the header for the output file(Georges_life.txt) the same as mentioned in the homework
15. write a blank line after the header and then write select contents of data into the output file
16. open the Georges_life text file to check the result
